To prove necessity, let P be a probability measure on Omega. Then, for x equals P {1, 2} equals P {1} + P {2}, y equals P {2, 3} equals P {2} + P {3}, and z equals P {1, 3} equals P {1} + P {3} we have by definition that 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 1, 0 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 1, and 0 less than or equal to z less than or equal to 1, and furthermore we compute that x + y + z equals 2(P {1} + P {2} + P {3}) equals 2P (Omega) equals 2, thus proving the necessity. Conversely, assume that 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 1, 0 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 1, 0 less than or equal to z less than or equal to 1, and x + y + z equals 2. Then, define the desired countably additive probability measure P as follows: P (phi) equals 0, P {1} equals 1 − y, P {2} equals 1 − z, P {3} equals 1 − x, P {1, 2} equals x, P {1, 3} equals z, P {2, 3} equals y, P {1, 2, 3} equals 1. Chapter 1: The need for measure theory 2 It is easily checked directly that for any two disjoint sets A, B subset of Omega, we have P (A union B) equals P (A) + P (B) For example, if A equals {1} and B equals {2}, then since x + y + z equals 2, P (A union B) equals P {1, 2} equals x while P (A) + P (B) equals P {1} + P {2} equals (1 − y) + (1 − z) equals 2 − y − z equals (x + y + z) − y − z equals x equals P (A union B).",

		"solution": "(a) Yes. Let A, B subset of Omega be disjoint. We consider two different cases. Case 1: At least one of A or B is infinite. Then A union B is infinite. Consequently, P (A union B) and at least one of P (A) or P (B) will be infinite. Hence, P (A union B) equals infinity and P (A) + P (B) equals infinity , implying P (A union B) equals infinity equals P (A) + P (B). Case 2: Both of A and B are finite. Then P (A union B) equals |A union B| equals |A| + |B| equals P (A) + P (B). Accordingly, P is finitely additive. (b) Yes. Let A1 , A2 , be a sequence of disjoint subsets of Omega. We consider two different cases. Case 1: At least one of An ’s is infinite. Then union infinity n equals 1 An is infinite.

On the other hand, its complement is finite having Lebesgue measure zero, a contradiction.) Now, let n 6 equals n0 , then An intersection An0 equals phi yields An subset of Acn0 .

		"solution": "(a) Here P (x, ) has an everywhere-positive density (with respect to Lebesgue measure). It follows that if A subset of X has positive Lebesgue measure, then P (x, A) > 0 for all x in X. So, the chain is phi-irreducible where phi is Lebesgue measure. As for aperiodicity, if X1 , . . . , Xd is a periodic decomposi- tion for some d greater than or equal to 2, then if x1 in X1 then P (x1 , X2 ) > 0. This implies that X2 has positive Lebesgue measure, which in turn implies that P (x, X2 ) > 0 for all x in X , even for x in X2 . This contradicts the assumption of periodic decomposition. So, no such periodic decomposition exists, i.e. the chain is aperiodic. (b) This chain is equivalent to adding an independent N (0, 1) random variable at each iteration.
